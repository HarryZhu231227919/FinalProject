### Project Description

This project will be an imitation of the game “Pac-Man”. There will be Pac-Man and 4 ghosts: Clyde (Orange), Blinky (Red), Pinky (Pink), and Inky (Cyan). The ghosts will move towards Pac-Man and when they collide, Pac-Man loses a life. Pac-Man will traverse the map trying to eat the orbs. The orbs will give points and some orbs will be bigger and give Pac-Man the ability to eat the ghosts. Once all of the orbs are gone, you beat the level and move on to the next level.

### Development Log
5/23/22 (James) - Created the Pac-Man board and the display function to display the board.

5/23/22 (Harry Zhu) - I increased the size of the screen and added a variable that would shift the Pac-Man map downwards so that enough space is created to display the level and the score. I made it display the score and the level after.

5/24/22 (James) - I finished pacman movement with the W,A,S,and D keys changing directions. I also fixed the board.
