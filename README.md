### Project Description
---
This project will be an imitation of the game “Pac-Man”. There will be Pac-Man and 4 ghosts: Clyde (Orange), Blinky (Red), Pinky (Pink), and Inky (Cyan). The ghosts will move towards Pac-Man and when they collide, Pac-Man loses a life. Pac-Man will traverse the map trying to eat the orbs. The orbs will give points and some orbs will be bigger and give Pac-Man the ability to eat the ghosts. Once all of the orbs are gone, you beat the level and move on to the next level.
